Ant_Robot_18259_18351,train,3.0,3.0,3.2,There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs.

Ant_Robot_19097_19290,train,3.11,2.67,3.22,"Antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task, on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants."

Ant_Robot_23162_23558,train,3.0,2.9,3.0,"Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants."

Ant_Robot_23571_23723,dev,3.0,3.0,3.12,"For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed."

Ant_Robot_2499_2518,train,3.0,2.8,3.0,The Ant & the Robot
Ant_Robot_2531_2631,train,2.9,3.1,3.1,Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers.
Ant_Robot_25547_25725,train,3.0,3.0,3.12,"These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle."
Ant_Robot_25738_25959,train,3.0,2.67,3.11,"In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location."
Ant_Robot_25960_26089,test,3.0,2.75,3.0,"The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al."
Ant_Robot_26090_26314,train,3.0,2.89,3.22,"Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance."
Ant_Robot_26315_26479,train,3.1,2.7,3.1,"We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters."
Ant_Robot_2632_2834,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year."
Ant_Robot_26480_26530,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,The first function might look something like this:
Ant_Robot_27478_27583,test,3.2,2.9,3.0,"In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source."
Ant_Robot_27584_27763,train,3.0,2.75,2.88,"To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature."
Ant_Robot_27764_27802,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,The code may look something like this:
Ant_Robot_2835_2969,train,3.0,2.75,3.0,"The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging."
Ant_Robot_28767_28841,train,3.0,2.6,3.2,"This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs."
Ant_Robot_28855_28950,train,3.0,2.64,3.0,"To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function."
Ant_Robot_28951_29112,train,3.0,2.8,3.1,"Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction."
Ant_Robot_29113_29161,train,3.0,3.0,3.14,"Regardless, this will be a very simple function."
Ant_Robot_29162_29189,train,3.0,3.0,3.29,I will include one example:
Ant_Robot_2970_3127,train,2.88,2.75,3.0,"Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest."
Ant_Robot_29941_30195,train,3.09,2.91,3.0,"Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds."
Ant_Robot_30208_30277,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them."
Ant_Robot_30278_30411,train,3.1,3.0,3.3,This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.
Ant_Robot_30412_30505,train,3.0,3.1,3.2,Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell.
Ant_Robot_30544_30582,train,3.0,2.4,3.0,The code may look something like this:
Ant_Robot_3128_3382,train,3.11,3.11,3.22,"Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable."
Ant_Robot_31867_31934,train,3.0,2.5,2.8,"Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it."
Ant_Robot_31935_32117,train,3.0,3.14,3.14,"A simple void function grip() taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached, at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying."
Ant_Robot_32118_32185,train,3.0,2.6,2.9,A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.
Ant_Robot_32198_32401,test,3.1,3.0,3.2,"Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors."
Ant_Robot_32402_32667,train,3.0,2.8,3.0,"Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones."
Ant_Robot_32668_32838,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk."
Ant_Robot_32839_32949,train,3.0,2.88,3.25,The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”
Ant_Robot_32950_33250,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models."
Ant_Robot_33251_33412,train,3.0,2.8,3.2,"Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine."
Ant_Robot_33413_33479,dev,3.0,3.1,3.1,Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:
Ant_Robot_3383_3579,train,3.0,2.88,2.75,"Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987)."
Ant_Robot_339_506,dev,2.6,2.9,3.0,"Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society."
Ant_Robot_34197_34329,train,2.9,2.5,3.1,"For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden()."
Ant_Robot_34330_34368,train,2.7,2.7,3.1,All three are void and take no inputs.
Ant_Robot_34381_34458,train,3.1,2.9,2.9,The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants.
Ant_Robot_34459_34606,test,3.0,3.0,3.0,"When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate."
Ant_Robot_34607_34748,train,3.0,2.86,3.0,"As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest."
Ant_Robot_34_112,train,3.0,2.91,3.0,Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching
Ant_Robot_35073_35165,dev,3.0,3.1,3.1,Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels.
Ant_Robot_35166_35264,train,3.0,2.6,2.9,The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:
Ant_Robot_36254_36326,train,3.0,2.9,3.0,"Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded."
Ant_Robot_36339_36491,train,3.1,2.8,3.0,"Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996)."
Ant_Robot_36492_36733,train,3.1,2.8,2.9,"Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
Ant_Robot_36734_36816,train,3.09,2.55,3.0,"Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest."
Ant_Robot_36817_36912,train,3.3,3.2,3.3,"As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in."
Ant_Robot_36913_37156,train,3.1,3.1,3.1,"Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior."
Ant_Robot_37157_37247,train,3.0,2.88,3.5,"Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors."
Ant_Robot_37260_37326,train,3.14,3.14,3.14,The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.
Ant_Robot_37327_37506,train,2.9,3.1,2.9,"It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise, and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52­­­oC, at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest."
Ant_Robot_37507_37683,train,2.9,2.7,3.1,"As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden."
Ant_Robot_37684_37738,train,3.0,2.88,2.88,A program encoding this behavior might look like this:
Ant_Robot_3839_3993,train,2.88,3.12,3.12,"These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems."
Ant_Robot_38994_39092,dev,3.0,2.7,3.1,"The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
Ant_Robot_39093_39216,train,3.14,2.86,3.0,"Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest."
Ant_Robot_39217_39310,train,3.0,3.11,3.11,"This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age."
Ant_Robot_39311_39565,train,2.88,2.75,3.12,"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005)."
Ant_Robot_39566_39686,dev,3.0,2.8,3.0,It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.
Ant_Robot_39687_39828,test,2.88,3.0,3.0,"In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34)."
Ant_Robot_39829_39995,train,3.0,2.9,3.1,"Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60)."
Ant_Robot_3994_4236,train,3.0,3.2,3.1,"In the case of midden work, Antie must be able to identify garbage, grasp it, carry it out of the nest, and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum (or until stimulated to switch behaviors)."
Ant_Robot_39996_40158,train,3.1,2.7,3.2,"To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones."
Ant_Robot_40159_40337,train,3.0,2.9,2.9,"This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45)."
Ant_Robot_40338_40376,train,3.0,3.0,3.14,The code may look something like this:
Ant_Robot_4237_4333,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
Ant_Robot_43115_43251,dev,3.1,2.7,3.1,Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.
Ant_Robot_43252_43404,train,3.0,3.0,3.1,"Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow."
Ant_Robot_4334_4601,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit."
Ant_Robot_43405_43517,train,3.1,3.0,3.2,A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.
Ant_Robot_43518_43610,train,3.0,2.5,3.0,Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):
Ant_Robot_46013_46137,train,2.9,2.8,3.0,The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.
Ant_Robot_4602_4914,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest."
Ant_Robot_46529_46637,train,3.0,2.89,3.11,"The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R."
Ant_Robot_46638_46714,train,3.0,2.7,3.1,Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume.
Ant_Robot_46715_46868,train,3.0,3.1,3.1,"This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest."
Ant_Robot_46869_46975,train,3.0,2.62,2.88,This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them.
Ant_Robot_46976_47065,dev,3.0,2.9,2.9,It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.
Ant_Robot_47066_47136,train,3.0,2.83,3.17,"The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:"
Ant_Robot_47971_48163,train,3.0,3.14,3.29,"Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47)."
Ant_Robot_48164_48282,train,3.0,2.86,3.0,"To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon."
Ant_Robot_48283_48313,train,3.0,2.8,3.1,The code might look like this:
Ant_Robot_4915_5103,train,3.12,3.25,3.12,"An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is."
Ant_Robot_50069_50170,dev,3.1,2.9,3.1,"Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors."
Ant_Robot_50171_50290,train,2.9,2.9,3.4,"Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work."
Ant_Robot_50291_50564,test,3.0,2.9,2.9,"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot."
Ant_Robot_50565_50725,dev,3.0,2.9,3.1,"To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
Ant_Robot_50726_51096,dev,3.2,3.0,2.9,"The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002)."
Ant_Robot_507_563,train,2.89,2.67,3.0,"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler."
Ant_Robot_5104_5377,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,"This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998)."
Ant_Robot_51097_51172,train,3.0,2.8,3.3,Activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate.
Ant_Robot_51173_51388,train,3.0,2.88,3.0,"According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue."
Ant_Robot_51389_51606,train,2.88,2.75,3.0,"For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers."
Ant_Robot_51607_51676,train,3.11,2.89,3.0,The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:

Ant_Robot_53596_53976,train,3.2,3.3,3.2,"Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary."
Ant_Robot_5378_5513,train,3.0,3.14,3.29,"In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest."
Ant_Robot_53977_54388,train,3.0,2.78,3.0,"Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance."

Ant_Robot_7035_7120,dev,3.0,3.0,3.0,"In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors."
Ant_Robot_7121_7376,train,3.09,2.73,3.0,"In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae."
Ant_Robot_7377_7449,train,3.0,2.88,3.25,"On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure."
Ant_Robot_7450_7523,train,3.0,2.75,3.13,The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.
Ant_Robot_7536_7702,train,3.0,3.0,3.2,"The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius."
Ant_Robot_7703_7886,train,3.0,2.83,3.17,"Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation."
Ant_Robot_7899_8030,train,3.0,2.73,3.09,Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes.
Ant_Robot_8031_8256,train,3.12,3.0,3.0,"These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5)."
Ant_Robot_804_1139,train,2.9,3.0,2.9,"No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them."
Ant_Robot_8269_8372,train,3.1,3.1,3.1,The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects.
Ant_Robot_8373_8595,test,3.0,3.3,3.1,"The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function."
Ant_Robot_8596_8740,train,3.1,3.1,3.3,"The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions."
Ant_Robot_8753_8959,train,3.1,3.1,3.1,"The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern."
Ant_Robot_8960_9254,train,2.9,3.0,3.1,"These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002)."
Ant_Robot_9255_9487,test,3.0,2.75,3.12,"Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers."

Ant_Robot_9858_10062,train,3.0,2.75,3.25,"This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning."

Bartok_10721_10876,dev,2.9,3.1,3.1,The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.
Bartok_10877_11177,train,3.0,2.71,2.86,"As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures."
Bartok_1100_1186,train,3.0,3.0,3.0,Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.”

Bartok_1234_1563,train,3.0,3.0,3.2,"While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order."
Bartok_12539_12727,train,2.9,2.7,3.2,"We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77."

Bartok_14045_14140,dev,3.0,3.11,3.33,Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.
Bartok_14188_14379,train,3.0,2.89,2.89,"While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context."

Bartok_14696_14879,train,3.0,3.0,3.1,"Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2."
Bartok_14880_14995,train,3.0,2.7,3.1,"In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant."

Bartok_19171_19354,train,2.8,2.8,3.0,"The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯."

Bartok_20798_21023,dev,3.0,2.89,3.11,"The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center)."
Bartok_21140_21307,train,3.0,2.44,3.22,"The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C."

Bartok_21387_21700,train,3.0,2.55,3.0,"The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation."
Bartok_21701_21944,dev,3.0,2.88,3.0,"Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section."

Bartok_23177_23298,train,3.0,3.0,3.22,"The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences."

Bartok_25138_25272,train,3.12,3.25,3.12,Bartók is one of the many early-twentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality.
Bartok_25273_25588,train,3.1,3.1,3.1,"While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work."
Bartok_25589_25843,train,3.2,3.1,3.2,"Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum."

Bartok_3735_3949,train,3.1,3.2,3.0,"In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins."
Bartok_3950_4223,dev,3.29,2.86,3.14,"Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg."
Bartok_4224_4413,dev,3.0,2.56,3.0,"The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition."

Bartok_5564_5694,train,3.0,2.9,2.9,"As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures."
Bartok_562_700,train,3.0,2.9,2.9,"The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement."
Bartok_5742_6025,test,3.0,3.0,3.0,"The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece."
Bartok_6026_6176,train,3.0,2.9,3.0,"To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center."
Bartok_6177_6348,test,3.0,2.9,3.1,"The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale."
Bartok_6349_6459,train,2.9,2.5,3.1,"Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself."
Bartok_6460_6654,dev,3.12,2.88,3.12,"The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive."
Bartok_6655_6874,train,3.0,2.63,3.37,"Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set."
Bartok_7190_7329,train,3.1,2.8,3.1,"Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths."
Bartok_7330_7450,test,2.9,2.9,2.9,Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.
Bartok_7469_7600,test,3.0,3.0,3.1,If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.
Bartok_7617_7722,train,3.0,2.9,2.9,"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯."
Bartok_7723_7859,train,3.1,3.0,3.1,"The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭."
Bartok_7860_7988,train,2.8,2.9,2.9,"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F."
Bartok_7989_8153,train,3.1,3.1,3.2,So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.
Bartok_8154_8344,train,2.9,2.9,2.9,"We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth."

Bartok_8573_8840,train,3.1,2.9,2.9,"Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples."
Bartok_8841_8999,train,3.0,2.9,3.0,"This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8."
Bartok_9000_9234,train,3.0,3.11,3.0,"So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole."
Bartok_9247_9408,train,3.0,2.71,3.0,"The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor."
Bartok_9409_9632,train,3.0,2.67,3.0,"This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor."
